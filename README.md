# Linux-Directory-Management-and-Command-Line-Proficiency-Project2

The project is a university-level assignment aimed at reinforcing students' understanding of the Linux operating system's command-line interface and file management. The task involves creating a specific directory structure, writing scripts to manipulate files, creating macros in the vi editor, and applying file permissions and linking techniques. Students are required to perform a series of practical exercises such as creating directories, writing and editing text files, copying files, and modifying file permissions. The purpose of the project is to help students develop hands-on skills in navigating Linux systems and working with commands effectively, which are essential for roles in systems administration or software development. The project is due for submission on Moodle and emphasizes independent work without collaboration.
